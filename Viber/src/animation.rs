//! glTF animation — clip discovery, state selection and playback.
//!
//! Characters arrive from the asset pipeline as animated GLBs carrying a whole
//! catalogue of clips (the `simple-rpg` hero ships 37: `idle`, `walk`, `run`,
//! `attack`, `death`, …). Bevy loads them but plays nothing on its own, so
//! every character stood in its bind pose — the T-pose in the world.
//!
//! This module does four things:
//!
//! 1. **Bind** — when a glTF scene finishes spawning, build an
//!    [`AnimationGraph`] from every clip in the file and hand it to the
//!    `AnimationPlayer` the glTF loader placed on the scene root.
//! 2. **Resolve** — map a gameplay [`AnimState`] onto whichever clip the file
//!    actually ships. Naming is not consistent across the pipeline: the hero
//!    has `idle` / `walk` / `run`, while retargeted Quaternius rigs have
//!    `Animator3D_BreatheIdle` / `Animator3D_Walk`. [`normalize_clip_name`]
//!    strips the tool prefix and punctuation so both resolve.
//! 3. **Drive** — pick the state from the character's own motion and cross-fade
//!    into it.
//! 4. **Arbitrate** — one-shot actions (attack, gesture, death) take the clip
//!    for exactly as long as the clip lasts, and the motion driver is locked
//!    out meanwhile instead of fighting it frame by frame.
//! 5. **Survive scene swaps** — the render-LOD ladder
//!    ([`crate::render_lod`]) replaces a character's `WorldAssetRoot` as it
//!    crosses distance tiers, and that swap despawns the whole old subtree,
//!    bound `AnimationPlayer` included. [`rearm_after_scene_swap`] notices the
//!    swap and re-arms the bind with the new tier's own gltf — clips are
//!    per-gltf assets — while [`bind_animations`] re-binds in place, keeping
//!    the locomotion state so a swap mid-chase reads as a step change and not
//!    as a reset through idle.
//!
//! ## Why the arbitration matters
//!
//! [`AnimationTransitions::play`] calls `AnimationPlayer::start`, which
//! **replays** the target clip — `seek_time` goes back to zero. Calling it once
//! per frame therefore pins a character on frame 0 of its own walk cycle: the
//! rig looks rigid, "stops" while walking, and every threshold flap reads as a
//! discrete pop. Every playback path here is idempotent for that reason: the
//! clip is only (re)started when the *resolved graph node* actually changes,
//! which also means a state change that falls back onto the same clip does not
//! restart it.
