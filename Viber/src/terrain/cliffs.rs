//! Procedural cliffs — the one carve that *wants* the vertical step.
//!
//! Every other ground feature (roads, rivers, lakes) feathers its edges with
//! the adaptive falloff because a stray one-texel wall reads as a rendering
//! artifact. A cliff is the opposite: the step IS the feature. The u16 grid
//! represents near-vertical walls faithfully (a 30 m drop between adjacent
//! ~1 m texels reads ~86°) and the monotone Catmull-Rom sampler preserves
//! the step without ringing, so cliffs live in the heightfield like every
//! other feature — colliders, spawners and `sample_mesh_surface` stay in
//! sync for free.
//!
//! # Geometry
//!
//! The authored `path` is the **crest line**; the face band extends one-sided
//! on the drop side, `[0, width]` meters from the path. Per station the
//! carve samples the terrain just outside both ends of the band:
//!
//! * `top_y` — the crest height (top side, untouched by the carve);
//! * `bot_y` — the natural toe height (just beyond the band).
//!
//! Inside the band the design surface lerps `top_y → bot_y` through the
//! profile curve, so an auto drop (`height` absent) reshapes whatever
//! elevation difference the place already has — the wall adapts to the
//! terrain, not the other way round. An authored `height` overrides the toe:
//! `bot_y = min(natural, top_y − height)`, which caps drops that are too
//! tall and digs a quarry-style pit into flat ground.
//!
//! # Profiles
//!
//! * [`CliffProfile::Vertical`] — smoothstep S-curve across the band: natural
//!   shoulders, the steepest face in the middle.
//! * [`CliffProfile::Concave`] — `t^0.4`: vertical at the crest, leaning
//!   back toward the toe — the quarry/cirque wall, as close to an undercut
//!   as a 2.5D heightfield gets.
//! * [`CliffProfile::Terraced`] — quantized ledges (~3 m tall) with
//!   deterministic per-step jitter: mesas and treads.
//!
//! Determinism: all samples are taken **before** the stroke opens and every
//! variation (band wobble, step jitter) comes from `seed` + position hashes,
//! never from RNG or mid-carve reads — same seed, same world.
