//! `<RockFeatures>` — arches, caves and rock bridges seeded over a region.
//!
//! Every volumetric feature so far is authored point by point: someone picks
//! the XZ, reads the terrain, and writes the tag. That is the right tool for
//! the landmark you meant, and the wrong one for the twenty background
//! features that make a badlands read as badlands.
//!
//! This tag seeds them. It is **not** a new kind of solid: it resolves into
//! ordinary [`ArchSpec`], [`CaveSpec`] and [`BridgeSpec`] values, which then
//! take exactly the same path through the bootstrap as if they had been
//! typed by hand. Nothing downstream knows the difference, so nothing
//! downstream had to change.
//!
//! # Site discipline
//!
//! A cave is the only seeded feature that SUBTRACTS — its mouth ramp cuts an
//! open notch into the ground wherever the terrain does not absorb it. So a
//! cave is only seeded where the ground climbs ahead of the site (the
//! pé-de-montanha test, `min-rise`), and the WHOLE resampled path must
//! clear every guard — water, roads, cliff walls, pads, features already in
//! the world — without ever diving into somebody else's valley. A candidate
//! that fails is skipped, never forced: budgets are ceilings, not quotas.
//! Arches and bridges are union solids and keep the lighter site checks.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The seeding is a pure function of `(spec, height field, guards)`: a
//! jittered lattice hashed with [`hash01`], the same generator the cliffs use.
//! No RNG state, no iteration order from a hash map — the same world authored
//! twice seeds the same rocks in the same places, which is the contract every
//! [`VoxelMod`](super::mods::VoxelMod) build already keeps.
//!
//! ```xml
//! <RockFeatures name="badlands" region="-200 -200 200 200" seed="9"
//!               arches="6" caves="3" bridges="2"
//!               min-slope="25" max-slope="70" min-drop="6" spacing="40" />
