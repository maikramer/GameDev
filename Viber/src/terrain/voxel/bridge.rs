//! `<Bridge>` — a crossing you can actually walk on.
//!
//! The engine already had a bridge of sorts: `<Segment profile="bridge">`
//! reports a flat deck ribbon at `deck_y` and skips the corridor carve
//! (`super::super::roads`). That ribbon is a *drawn* surface only — it never
//! reaches the voxel field, so it has no collider, and the hero walks onto it
//! and falls into the river.
//!
//! This tag is the volumetric answer. A bridge is a chain of union solids in
//! the [`VoxelField`](super::field::VoxelField), which means the transvoxel
//! mesher draws it and `ColumnColliderBake` bakes those exact triangles into
//! the column's trimesh. Standing on it is not a feature that had to be
//! written: it is what "the collider is the surface" already guarantees.
//!
//! # Authoring
//!
//! ```xml
//! <!-- masonry: arcades, piers on the bed, parapets -->
//! <Bridge name="ponte_velha" path="128 0  160 0" width="6" style="stone"
//!         rise="3" thickness="1.2" spans="3" pier-width="3" parapet="0.9" />
//!
//! <!-- natural rock span: no piers, organic haunches into both banks -->
//! <Bridge name="arco_do_rio" path="-20 40  10 55" width="9"
//!         style="natural" rise="5" thickness="4" />
//! ```
//!
//! Like `<Cave>` and `<Arch>`, `path` is XZ and the height comes from the
//! terrain: the deck springs from the ground at both ends, so a bridge drawn
//! across a valley lands on its two banks without hand-placed Y.
