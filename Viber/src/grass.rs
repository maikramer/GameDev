//! Ground cover — the instanced grass field that turns the terrain shader
//! from "a green surface" into "a meadow you are standing in".
//!
//! `<Vegetation>` spawns one glTF scene per tuft; at ~800 scenes per tag over
//! a 4 km world that is one plant every 90 m — invisible. This module takes
//! the opposite approach, the one every open-world engine takes for grass:
//!
//! * geometry is **baked**, not instanced per entity — one merged mesh per
//!   16 m tile, so a whole square of meadow is a single draw call;
//! * tiles **stream** around the camera in three density tiers and are
//!   dropped (mesh asset included) the moment they leave the ring;
//! * the wind lives in the **vertex shader** ([`GRASS_WGSL`]): one travelling
//!   gust wave shared by the entire field, so the meadow breathes as one
//!   surface instead of N props twitching out of phase.
//!
//! Placement is a pure function of world position (hash noise + the terrain
//! sampler), so the field is stable frame to frame and across runs: walking
//! away and back rebuilds exactly the same blades.
//!
//! Knobs: `VIBER_GRASS=0` disables the field, `VIBER_GRASS_DENSITY=<f32>`
//! scales every tier (0.5 = half the blades, for a slow GPU).
